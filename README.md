# Radar-Navigation-System-
if You want to build a similar projects and want to learn how to connect sensor and want to explore computational power of processor so you can take a guide from this reporitory ,
below are the few prerequisite 
I have use Arduino Uno as microcontroller for controling navigation ,sensing objects and computing distance and displaying real time data 
Navigation - for navigating sensor to sense onject at various angle i have use Servo Motor 
Sensor - For sensing object at various angle i have use ultersonic sensor 
for implement the logic and write code i have use Arduino Uno
